6. About (Short Description / Summary):
Modern hand held devices such as smart phones and PDAs have become increasingly powerful in recent years. Dramatic breakthroughs in processing power along with the number of extra features included in these devices have opened the doors to a wide range of commercial possibilities. In particular, most cell phones regularly include cameras, processors comparable to PCs from only a few years ago, and internet access. As mobile devices become more like PCs they have come to replace objects we tend to carry around such as checkbooks, credit cards, cameras, planners, mp3 players, etc. In short, we are using them to accomplish our daily tasks. One application that falls into this category is our “Camera Contact” Application developed for the Google Android Phones.
